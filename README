__Usage__
Intended as a high-end laboratory bench supply.

Absolute maximum input voltage is 61.7VPeak. Recommend 48V from linear low-leakage medical power supply. Of course, cheaper transformers will generally be used in practice.

Outputs are ultra-low-noise, ripple estimated below 0.3uV. Voltages include 3.3V, 5V, adjustable 3.24-50V, and midpoint.

Minimum ripple and common-mode noise may be achieved on battery power.

Minimum load is 12mA for both adjustable rails. A 1k resistor may be needed to prevent uncontrolled voltage rise, especially for the midpoint reference. If not otherwise guaranteed, such a load may be soldered across the optional F2, F3, and F4 polyfuse inputs.

__Design__
Multi-stage linear regulator. Many laboratory bench supplies are switching regulators, with questionable noise output.

High-power components are referenced to the bottom of the PCB, to permit arbitrary heatsinks.

Wide traces mostly on the top side are intentionally used to permit PCB isolation milling. However, to generate the required files, the minimalist outline should be removed.

USA companies provide all parts in these schematics.

__Safety__
Output voltage is fairly high, and input isolation is not part of the regulator. Test equipment must be used carefully.
